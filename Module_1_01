1)Greedy choice
2)Optimal

i.e every sub smaller problem youre 
using the greedy choice .


diff b/w pruing and greedy

eg n*x chess board

give me one sol such that 
to place n queens so that 
no one attack each other
 


we have one sol 
n!
we will try we will choose every posi and see which isnt
possible 

but with greedy we can try by saying we will place
the queens at knight positions and see how it would
 turn out and it might turn out that youre able to 
 build the board so youre not seeing all
 possible approach you have one particular approach
  and you try
 
 so like base on one state you know what to take and
 based on another state you know what to take
 so its state depedent 
 like this state would have that greedy choice 
 and that particular state it would that greedy choice
 
 
 Practice based algo cant get it staraight away
 
 there are some known greedy techinques 
 like we did a idea of exhange arguments if we
 didn know that techinque we wouldnt of known 
 what condi we would sort tho right ?
 
 this this this greedy choice



chess board 
lets say we have some rooks on the board 
rook - attacks in its row and its col each rook
take hold of some row and some col

find out the largest rect area on the board which is unattacked

let there are k num of rooks given on chess
board with their coordinates
f/o the largest caontinous 
area of rect that u see unattacked

in greedy one concept is very imp is
"TAKE OUT THE INDEPENDENCE"

SO CONCECUTIVE Y'S DEFINES THE = WIDTH =Wi
AND CONSECUTIVE X'S DEFINES THE = HEIGHT= Hi

if there are N distinct ys and M distinct x's
we get how many distinct reactangles ?

how many bounded rect we can build ?

y2- y1 = w1

y3-y2= x2

y4-y3=w3 . .... . ... yn-yn-1= wn-1
xi-xi-1 -1

similarly we'll get 
m-1 = for height

so for width we can get = wi- wi-1 -1
and for height we write = xi-xi-1 -1

so no. of rectangle ? every weight will
combine with every height possible

so M-1 * N-1
and give some rect with max area 
we can say 
max(h,w)
so we can write 
max(h) and max(w) if h and wt independent

so find max of width
and find max of height in this array 


cus for every height in space width is same and for every weight 



=========================================
max ht and max of wt
idea : just craete a vec contains  which all rows has row 
and create a vec which contains which all cols have rows
sort them individually  take the diff between the consecutive points and take the max out of them

take the diff between each two max consecutive difference points of y coordinates or the cols 
and max x coordinates consecutive diff or row
just mulitiply them.
===================================================================================

Q)
lets say there N person their coordinates are given to you!
op -> move 1 person by 1 unit out of any 4 direction
min no of moves needed to make them move at a single point!

IN THESE 2D KIND OF PROB THINK OF WHAT HAPPENS IN 1D APPROACH FIRST 
like in this case think of youre in  1D array and you have some ppl on it tell me the min moves to make everyone meet!

let N x1 x2 x3 x4 x5 

so let say they meet at X

so we can say 

what we want 
now the ques becomes f/o X such that this exp is min
min(X-x1+ X-x2+ X-x3 + X-x4----- +  X-xn)

******WHENEVER YOU HAVE TO MINIMISE THIS KIND OF EXP JUST TAKE THE MEDIAN 

SO WHEN YOU HAVE A PT IN SPACE LIKE (Ax-Bx + Ay- By ) we get Manhattan distance**
and in this case if its asked find the min distance between those two points 
say thats the medium of them would give

Eulidean distance like (Ax- Bx)^2 + (Ay-By)^2 then we go for geometric mean 
would wusing the average works 


now for 2d we have n points sum (X-xi + Y-yi)

in 2d take independent median of x axis and y axis 

median of all x and median of all y


there are Q queries
in each query you will have X
find out 

... x1. ..... x2....x3....x4...x5.....
sum from 1 to N |X-xi|
